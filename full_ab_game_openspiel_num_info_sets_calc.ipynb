But I think 3 lead distances is pretty low for a baserunner? I don't know I feel like you'd want more options than that. But maybe not honestly that could be like you have a short lead, a normal lead, and a big lead, so maybe 3 is perfectly reasonable. It'll be interesting to see as I start to solve for approximate equilibria how many lead distances the baserunner is actually choosing between. Is he mixing between all of the options or does he actually end up choosing between like 2 or 3 options. If it were up to me, based on the statcast range of lead distances, I'd at least want 8-14 feet, so 7 options, which apparently gives billions of info states (1e9). Billions would be tough to do in memory with vanilla cfr, but not impossible I don't think. But that would take a lot of effort and thought to efficiently store that in memory and to efficiently run those iterations, and then even after that you'd probably have to run iterations for days, so I think at that point we could justify going away from vanilla cfr. But then really we should include some values above and below 8 and 14 feet because if you average is 14 or 8 then sometimes you will be lower than that and sometimes higher. So let's say we did 6 to 16 feet, which is 11 options that results in tens of billions of info states (1e10). And foot long increments are pretty big, so if we did half a foot increments, that's 22 options which gives tens of trillions of info states (1e14), so now we are bigger than heads up limit holdem. And then finally, if we did the values that Scott Powers did, which is 0 to 20 feet in 0.1 step increments, so n = 200, we get 1e20, which is bigger than any solved game.\n","\n","So my vote I think would be 6 to 16 feet if not just 0 to 20 feet broken down by feet, which will give either 1e10 info sets if we do 6 to 16 or 1e13 if we do 0 to 20, and 1e13 is exactly the same size as heads up limit holdem, so it is quite large. All that's to say, it is in our best interest to do the imperfect recall version of the game. In that version, we have an info set for the 12 ball/strike counts, 3 disengagement counts (0, 1, 2), and let's say 20 lead distances, which would come out to 20 X 12 X 3 = 720, so we go from 1e13 info sets to 720 lol. And, Lanctot's thesis suggests that we can run vanilla CFR on that version of the game and still minimize regret.  My concern though is even though we save a ton on memory, I'm not sure we save on runtime because we're still traversing every possible history. I wonder if you could do it in stages though. So stage 1 you start with a 3-2 count with two disengagements and you just run cfr to get the optimal strategy in that subgame. Then in stage 2, which is really stage 7, you replace the nonterminal children nodes with the values from the nodes you just got in stage 1 and turn them into terminal nodes, so then you can solve stage 2 as quickly as you solved stage 1 except that there are more options. You could have 3-2 with 1 disengagment or 2-2 with 2 disengagments or 3-1 with 2 disengeagments. Then you continue that process, so stage 3 which is really stage 6 you could have 3-2 with no disengagements, 2-2 with 1 disengagement, 1-2 with 2 disengagments, 2-1 with 2 disengagments, 3-0 with 2 disengamgents, etc. I think with this approach, each stage is a managably sized game that you can solve, and even though there are multiple root nodes in each stage, there would never be a crazy large number of root nodes, so you could easily parallelize over the roots.\n","\n","I need to really read into the Lanctot phd disseration on imperfect recall games to make sure that the benefit of imperfect recall is only in memory and not in runtime. You would still have to visit every possible history. But if that is the case then I think the stage by stage approach will probably help because solving one stage at a time is much more managable. In fact, you may not even need to do cfr you may just be able to do like a normal form solver. Yeah as I'm writing this I have an idea, you totally could do a normal form solver on each stage. I think they'll be small enough, and in fact you can do better than the normal form you can do the behavioral strategy form that we did in the pitch sequencing paper where you have |A| columns for each info set. So in our case the pitcher can choose to pitch or pickoff, so if there are lets say 20 lead distances and therefore 20 info sets, the pitcher would have 40 rows or columns, 2 for each info set representing their behavioral strategy in each info set. Then you solve as you did in the pitch sequencing paper, but you start with the stage 8 game because then in the stage 7 games you can fill in the values of the nonterminal children nodes with the stage 8 game value, so you just have to work backward through the stages and then you will have an exact equilibrium instead of an epsilon-equilibrium, and my guess is it'll take less time than cfr would take. And I think you would only have to do that 36 times, once for each combination of ball/strike/num disengagements because we aren't doing the perfect recall version of the game, so you're just doing that simple linear program 36 times, and you can even do some in parallel, and then you're done!\n","\n","Once you have that coded up and working I think you're ready to reach out to Scott Powers. You also may want to consider incorporating the pitch strategy and the batter swing strategy into the game, which would obviously make things more cmoplicated and may end up requiring some cfr type of algorithm. I don't necessarily think we need to do that I think the simpler version is more than good enough, but it may be interesting nonetheless. It's just not very practical from a baseball perspective because you probably wouldn't be able to solve for strategies quickly enough to use in game, but maybe you would if you ignore the prior pitch embedding that optimuspitch uses, which we will ahve to do anyways most likely to keep the state space reasonably sized."],"metadata":{"id":"6a0cZbqrN88N"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"fJXVI5nto8rP"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#in the case where the batter has only one lead distance to choose from,\n","#if you end the game after any pitch, there are 6 information sets.
